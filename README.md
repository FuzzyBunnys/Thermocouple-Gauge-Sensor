# Thermocouple Gauge Sensor
This is a project detailing a project to build a measurement computer for a thermocouple vacuum gauge that is attached to a vacuum chamber. See the [GitHub pages for more information](https://fuzzybunnys.github.io/Thermocouple-Gauge-Sensor/). 
- The BOM is the bill of materials
- The documentation file is a word document containing technical information and context
- VacuumSensorV2 is the Mecrisp-Stellaris code
- Calibration Curve is an excel file that models the curve used to generate pressure measurements
- The Thermocouple Gauge folder contains all the Kicad files related to PCB layout and design
