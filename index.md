## Thermocouple Vacuum Gauge.

This is a project page detailing a microcontroller project that reads a vacuum thermocouple gauge. At its completion it will contain include all the necessary kicad files to create or modify your own pcb, a bill of materials (BOM) for the components necessary to assemble the pcb and the program to run the whole thing. It's core design is based on a circuit from [The Bell Jar](http://www.belljar.net/tcgauge.htm).


### The PCB
The PCB is the first complete section of the project. It connects a [TI Tiva C Launchpad](https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C123GXL) to a [SparkFun LCD display](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16397) and non-inverting op-amp that amplifies the signal from the vacuum thermocouple gauge. It was designed in KiCad and the boards themselves were manufacture by OSH Park, though of course you are able to use whichever manufacturer you prefer. You can see the bare board and an assembled board below.
